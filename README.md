## Clipboard Kill Poster
This is a small script to help posting large numbers of EVE Online Killmails to zkillboard without linking your ESI keys directly

## How to Use
### Just copy the external kill link for any killmail
the script will watch your clipboard for any copied killmail url's and automatically post them to zkill

You can find this in the three dot menu on the top right of any killmail when in-game

To post lots of kills go to:
```
Corporation Window > Kill Reports > Right-Click a Killmail > Copy External Kill Link
```
or
```
Character Sheet > Interactions > Combat Log > Right-Click a Killmail > Copy External Kill Link
```
just right-click > copy kill link as fast as you can, the script will queue each kill to be posted as fast as zkillboard allows
